Hello,

I am a master student major in Intelligient Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University. Currently, I am advised by Professor Jaime Callan on IR-KB project. 

I have interets on information retrieval, data processing and information visualization. 
Previously, I finished my bachelor degree at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
