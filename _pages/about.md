Hello,

I am a master student major in Intelligent Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University. Currently, I am working with Professor Jamie Callan on IR-KB project. 

I have interests on information retrieval, data processing and information visualization. 

Previously, I finished my bachelor degree at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
